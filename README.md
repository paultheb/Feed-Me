Feed Me!
=======

Feed Me! is a mashup of the Yelp, IP-API Geolocation, and Google Maps Embed APIs. 

The text field feeds into a PHP script: retrieves the three highest rated locations which serve the type of food, or item of your preference (from Yelp) on the basis of your current location (by IP address), and lists them with a snippet of their most recent review and cummulative rating.

A map is also generated off of the location details provided by Yelp through the Google Maps Embed API.
